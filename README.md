# GDELT-Research-In-The-South-Pacific
This is a repository contains all my Jupyter notebooks (and my final report once it's finalized) of all my work as a UROC (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center) student at California State University Monterey Bay. During all my research, I am being guided by my research mentor Dr. Elizabeth Gooch from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA.
