This folder contains all the notes from all the work i did over the course of the semester. Many of the notebooks are not concise and well annotated because they are where i did most of my experimenting. Over the course of my research, i started with almost no experience with data aggregation using python and only data aggregation using SQL. From week to week i slowly improve my skills util to the point where i no longer needed SQL to do any data aggregation and can solely do all my calculation using python. I however still need to use SQL in order to query the GDELT data set and some of the subset datasets i created. 

I will slowly be uploading my notebooks as i go back and annotate some of the things i was doing at the time.
