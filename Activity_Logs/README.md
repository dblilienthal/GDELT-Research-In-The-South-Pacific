This folder contains all the notes from all the work i did over the course of the semester. Many of the notebooks are not concise and well annotated because they are where i did most of my experimenting. Over the course of my research, i started with almost no experience with data aggregation using python and only data aggregation using SQL. From week to week, i slowly improve my skills.  

I will slowly be uploading my notebooks as i go back and annotate some of the things i was doing at the time.
